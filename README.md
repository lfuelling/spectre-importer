## About the Firefly III Salt Edge / Spectre importer
This is a tool to import from Salt Edge / Spectre files into [Firefly III](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii). It works by using a personal access token to access your
Firefly III installation's API. It will then create transactions based upon the connections you have defined in your Salt Edge / Spectre account.
 
Salt Edge / Spectre isn't actually meant for this use case: it's a business service designed for people who build financial services like Mint.com or YNAB
. Or maybe, you're building an iPhone app? Then Salt Edge is something for you.

For us mortals however, we can use Salt Edge / Spectre's free tier to connect to our bank since it's inside of the limit that Salt Edge puts on free accounts.

### Purpose

Use this tool to (automatically) import from your bank into Firefly III using Salt Edge. If you're a bit of a developer, feel free to use this code to generate
 your own import tool.

### Features

* This tool will let you download or generate a configuration file, so the next import will go faster.

### Who's it for?

Anybody who uses Firefly III and wants to automatically import from Salt Edge.

## Getting Started

You can use this tool in several ways.

1. [Install it on your server using composer](https://firefly-iii.gitbook.io/firefly-iii-spectre-importer/installing-and-running/self_hosted).
2. [Use the Docker-image](https://firefly-iii.gitbook.io/firefly-iii-spectre-importer/installing-and-running/docker).

Generally speaking, it's easiest to use and install this tool the same way as you use Firefly III. And although it features an excellent web-interface, you can also use the command line to import your data. There are [upgrade instructions](https://firefly-iii.gitbook.io/firefly-iii-spectre-importer/upgrading/upgrade) for both methods of installation.

The [full usage instructions](https://firefly-iii.gitbook.io/firefly-iii-spectre-importer/) can be found in the documentation. Basically, this is the workflow:

### Using the web interface

1. [Set up and configure your Personal Access Token and Firefly III URL](https://firefly-iii.gitbook.io/firefly-iii-spectre-importer/installing-and-running/configure).
2. [Set up the necessary keys for Salt Edge / Spectre](#).
3. Connect to your bank, select a connection, etc.
5. [Map values in the spectre file to existing values in your database](https://firefly-iii.gitbook.io/firefly-iii-spectre-importer/importing-data/map).
6. [Enjoy the result in Firefly III](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii).

### Using the auto-import

1. Import at least once, so you'll have a configuration file.
2. [Run the Docker inline import command](https://firefly-iii.gitbook.io/firefly-iii-spectre-importer/importing-data/command_line)
